CBM Pet Joystick, Wifi and CB2-Sound

The adapter is connected to the Userport and uses the 8 bit I/Os and the handshake-line for the additional hardware. There are three joystick-ports, a dual-joystick and the "Stupid PET Tricks"-port. The ports, also CB2 used for 1bit-Sound are switchable to the Wifi-modem by a 74LS257 Multiplexer and a jumper. 
It uses the known, modded C64 Wifi-Modem software and a Wemos D1 Mini. Unfortunally in this first version are 300 up to 1200 Baud possible. 2400 Baud causes transfer-errors and I still must discover the issue. It was only tested with the second PET board 2001N.
For the CB2-line a seperate jumper is included to disconnect the LM386 amplifier, because in Wifi-mode it will produce aggy Rx-responses on the audio-line.

## Update-Diary
17.7.25
Added the fixed PETTERM v0.7.0 using the 2400 Baud fix. If it would'nt work and you struggeling with messy chars, pick up the original release and give it a try. You can adjust the timing in petterm.s, line 618.

15.7.25
The "2400 Baud"-Issue is nearly fixed. The PETTERM bitbanging IRQ lo-timer must be adjusted to the seemingly a touch faster WEMOS D1 Mini. It's in testing and an updated PETTERM for this setup will follow soon.

13.7.25
Two adapters: the "horizontal Joystick" and a "C2N-Breakout and Power-Adapter" were added in the adapter-folder. In the ZIPs you'll find Gerber production data.

## CB2-Sound
For driving and decoupling the CB2-Sound a LM386 driver is included. You can adjust the volume by the 10K potentiometer. It is only a small gain-stage (max. x20) to drive a 1 Watt/8Ohm speaker.

## WIFI-Modem
With the Wifi-Modem you'll able to connect your PET to a BBS by Telnet and the PETTERM. It uses the known, modded firmware for the WEMOS D1 NodeMCU. 



## PCB
![PCB](https://github.com/cbmuser/pet_joy/blob/main/images/pcb_top.png)

With the JOY/WIFI-Jumper you can swich between Joystick (open) oder Wifi (closed). With the Jumper near the LM386 you can cut the audio-line. On the right, below Joystick#1-port you can connect a small speaker.
